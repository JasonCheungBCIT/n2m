For this project, the coding guidelines are as follows.

1. Accessing views vs calling controller functions.
    - When accessing or redirecting towards a view (a file in a directory):
        Syntax: "folder/file"
    - When calling a method from a controller:
        Syntax: "controller.action"
    - These rules apply whether you're using Redirect or View class.
        ex. Redirect::to or View::make
    Rationale:
        Inflating a view is directly accesing a file within some directory,
        while using routes is much like calling a method in a object/class.

2. Calling/Redirecting to another method in controllers.
    - When calling another method in the same controller:
        Syntax: Redirect::action(NameofController@methodName)
    - When calling another method in another controller, try to use set-up routes:
        Ex. Redirect::to('predefined_route');
    Rationale:
        When calling another function inside the same class, there's not reason to go
        a roundabout way; Be explicit and simple.
        When calling another method in another class, we want to be as modular and
        abstract as possible; We don't want to know any internals or specifics.

3. Naming conventions
